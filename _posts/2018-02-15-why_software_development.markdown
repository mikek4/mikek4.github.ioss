I found myself in a scenario that most people can relate to. I am currently in a position where every day in the office is a struggle. I felt stuck in a poor work environment in an industry that didn't relate to anything I was even remotely interested in. After having a particularly hard day I decided that there is no reason that I should let myself suffer any longer. 

I decided to probe my interests and brainstorm which careers would be the best fit for me. I spend a significant amount of time on the computer. I love coming up with new ideas and with the power of the internet making almost anything is possible. This is the main draw that software development has for me. It is amazing to me that the only limit on what I can create is my own imagination. 

After wading through the initial lessons within the Flatiron program I have finally begun to feel the enjoyment from taking a challenging problem and coming up with a creative solution. I believe that this new career path is the right choice for me and I am excited to see all the possibilities that this new skillset will bring me. 

I am ready for bigger and bigger challenges as I go through this program and I am ready to absorb as much information as possible. I cannot wait to look back to this first post and see how far I have come. Hopefully in my brand new position as a web developer!
